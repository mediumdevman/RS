## Version 0.2.1
> Version 0.2.1 implements some basic features of the app
- Launcher properly boots application to whatever dr it is stored in
- Application takes inputs and provieds documentation with help command
- Add, Display, BestR commands all terminate the program as they don't have a purpose yet

> Things to add for Version 0.2.2 or 0.3.1 (depending on size of push)
- Actual fucntionality for the Add call.
- Changing and pushing the master.csv file to a seperate repo or server space where the data can remain unchanged and stored until next access
- more documentation as code is cluttered and hard to read

That's all for now,
Jack
